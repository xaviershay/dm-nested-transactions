dm-nested-transactions
----------------------

Adds nested transaction support to DataMapper. Only tested with Postgres, and it's a bit of a hack, so use at your own risk!

Install:
  gem install dm-nested-transactions

Usage:
  repository.adapter.extend(DataMapper::NestedTransactinos)

There's a rails/init.rb file that automatically does the above for you.
